# 👋 Hi, I'm Het Patel

I'm a Software Engineer specializing in designing and building **scalable distributed systems**, **infrastructure**, **Test/QA frameworks**, and **data/ML pipelines**.

My focus is on **backend and cloud-native architectures** that deliver high performance, reliability, and fault tolerance at scale.
